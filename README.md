# auto-rename

Rename a set of picture files. 
It is inteded to be applied to files of type RAW or JPG.
After the original files were copied from the camera, they carry a more or less useless name.
The idea is to replace the original file name with a name that has this naming rule:

      <date>-<time>-<original name>
